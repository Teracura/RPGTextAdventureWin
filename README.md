A .NET MAUI based RPG textBased game project

technologies used:
- C#
- Entity FrameWork Core
- .NET MAUI (with XAML for UI)

Should work on android as .NET MAUI is multi-platform but I haven't tested android or any apple related OSes as the main focus was a windows app, so you may encounter some UI issues when opening with android
